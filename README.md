Lane detection is a crucial task in the field of autonomous driving, which involves detecting and tracking the lane markings on the road 
to ensure safe and reliable driving. In this internship project, I have implementa lane detection algorithm using OpenCV library 
in Python language. The data set provided for this project is in form of videos captured from a dashboard camera mounted on a vehicle.

The objective of this project is to develop a lane detection system that can accurately detect and track the lanes in real-time videos. This 
will involve several steps, including pre-processing the video frames, detecting edges using Canny edge detection, identifying the region of
interest, and finally detecting and drawing the lane lines on the video frames using the Hough transform.

I use OpenCV, a powerful computer vision library, to perform these operations. OpenCV provides a wide range of tools and functions for 
image processing and computer vision, making it an ideal choice for this project. By the end of this project, we aim to develop a working lane
detection system that can accurately detect and track the lane markings in real-time videos.
